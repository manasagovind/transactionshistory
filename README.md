### Assignment: Personal Expense Tracker

### Objective:

Develop a RESTful API for managing personal financial records. Users can record their income and expenses, retrieve past transactions, and get summaries by category or time period.

### Tools and Technologies:

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite (for simplicity) or MongoDB (if you prefer a NoSQL solution)

### Requirements:

1. **Database Setup**
    - If using **SQLite**, create a database with tables:
        - `transactions`: id, type (income or expense), category, amount, date, description
        - `categories`: id, name, type (income or expense)
    - If using **MongoDB**, define collections:
        - `transactions`: { type, category, amount, date, description }
        - `categories`: { name, type }
2. **API Endpoints**
    - `POST /transactions`: Adds a new transaction (income or expense).
    - `GET /transactions`: Retrieves all transactions.
    - `GET /transactions/:id`: Retrieves a transaction by ID.
    - `PUT /transactions/:id`: Updates a transaction by ID.
    - `DELETE /transactions/:id`: Deletes a transaction by ID.
    - `GET /summary`: Retrieves a summary of transactions, such as total income, total expenses, and balance. Optionally, this can be filtered by date range or category.
3. **Functionality**
    - Implement route handlers for each endpoint.
    - Provide error handling to manage common issues like invalid transaction IDs, invalid inputs, etc.
    - Optionally add user authentication to protect the routes and associate transactions with specific users.
4. **Documentation**
    - Document your API endpoints with necessary request and response details.

### Deliverables:

- Source code in a GitHub repository.
- A `README.md` file that includes:
    - Setup and run instructions.
    - API documentation.
    - Postman screenshots demonstrating each API call.

### Bonus (Optional):

- Implement basic user authentication and link transactions to specific users.
- Add pagination to the `GET /transactions` endpoint to handle large volumes of data.
- Create an endpoint for generating reports, such as monthly spending by category
